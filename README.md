## Description 
The goal of this project was to create and deploy an application that allows a user to write and save notes so that they can keep track of their thoughts. This was accomplished with the express npm and different file system utilities to append new notes and delete notes as well as read prviously written notes. Developing this app strengthened my ability to write backend code that works with databases and made me familiar with Heroku for deploying apps.

## Installation
Click this link to view the deployed application: https://farmfreshyeets-challenge-11.herokuapp.com/ 

## Usage
To use this application, click the button labeled 'Get Started' to go to the notes page. Once there, you will see saved notes in the left column as well as a empty fields for note title and body in the main section. When you have typed both a title and body for the note, you will see a save button has appeared in the top-right. Clicking the save button will save the note and clear the fields again, and you will now be able to see your note in the left column. Clicking the name of the note will show the note content on the main section. If you wish to delete the note, click the red trash icon to the right of the note title in the left column and it will be removed.
